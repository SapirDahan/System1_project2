# System1_project2
In this assignment, we tackled two different problems. The first part involved creating a graph and determining whether there exists a path between two given edges, as well as finding the shortest path if one exists. In the second part, we focused on solving the Knapsack problem. We are given five items, each with its own value and weight, and our goal is to find the optimal combination of items that would yield the maximum profit while staying within a given weight limit. To achieve this, we are employing dynamic programming techniques to systematically evaluate combinations and identify the most profitable solution.
